# 🚀 agentic-dev-workflow-chrome-extensions

Chrome extensions built for developers who code with AI agents —  
and want to intentionally use their “agent waiting time” differently.

Agentic development is not constant typing.  
It’s asynchronous.

Prompt → Wait → Review → Refine.

This repository explores how to design that waiting time better.

---

## 🧠 Concept

When working with AI agents:

- You send a prompt
- The agent processes
- You wait
- You review and iterate

Those waiting moments create micro-gaps in attention.

Instead of uncontrolled distraction, this project experiments with:
- Intentional context switching
- Controlled micro-entertainment
- Fast return-to-focus mechanisms
- Async-friendly developer workflows

Yes — this may include things like watching YouTube Shorts during processing time.

But intentionally.

## 🎯 Philosophy

Agentic coding changes how we work:

- Less constant typing
- More thinking and reviewing
- More idle compute moments

The goal is not distraction.

The goal is:
- Managing idle cognitive cycles
- Reducing frustration during AI latency
- Maintaining flow without burnout

Used poorly → procrastination  
Used intentionally → sustainable workflow

## ✨ Extensions (Planned / Experimental)

### 🎬 Micro-Entertainment Panel
Quick-access short-form content while AI agents process requests.

### ⏱ Agent Activity Indicator
Visual indicator showing when the AI task is running.

### 🔒 Context Lock
One-click return to your previous development tab and context.

### 🔄 Flow Resume Helper
Reminds you what you were working on before switching context.
